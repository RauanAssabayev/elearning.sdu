# Quiz Game

This is a volunteer project, quiz game built with jQuery and Bootstrap for local school's Mastermind competition.
The game picks a random question from an array every time a button is pressed. Next you just simply add points,
to whichever team deserves them.

This is just a part of the project (original project was done in Polish and questions were prepared by teachers from the school), with core functionality.

Main project also had slightly different layout (I was told there will be at least 6 teams taking part in competition), 3 teams layout is just for the purpose of showcasing the project on one, slick page.

## Getting Started

Download project files and start them in your browser. That's it!
Adding new teams in html markup will still retain functionality with points (it's done via dynamic function), so you can have as many teams as you want :).

Past all the questions in a form of array in script.js file.
